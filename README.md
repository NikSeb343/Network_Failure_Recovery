This work implements rerouting, or giving a dynamic, alternate path to minimise link failure, on a Mininet. SDN typically consists of devices with distinct data and control planes, with a controller a unique device serving as the system's brain. The Pox controller is utilised in this experiment, and Mini edit, a Python programme that serves as a GUI for constructing topologies and displays the interrupt-less ping flow, is used to observe the experimental topology. This implementation forms the basis for the enhanced failure recovery techniques.
